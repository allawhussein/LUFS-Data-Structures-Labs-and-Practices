# Problem 1

Write a functions that perform a level order traversal of dynamically implemented Binary Tree.

# Problem 2

Write a function that computes the maximum width of a dynamically implemented BT. We define the maximum width of a BT as the maximum number of nodes located at the same level.

Using the following modified data structure
```C
typedef  struct {
	Btree tree; 
	int level;
} elementq;
```

# Problem 3

Write a function that computes the maximum width of a dynamically implemented BT. We define the maximum width of a BT as the maximum number of nodes located at the same level.
